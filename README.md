# Proof of concept - Predict OCP cluster upgrade failures

### Current Limitations

* Does not parse dynamic function calls such as anonymous functions from a map because they are mapped at runtime and were too much work for POC [like _bindata here](https://github.com/openshift/machine-config-operator/blob/master/pkg/operator/assets/bindata.go#L1195).
